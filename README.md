# Reference-style-macros
Notepad++ macros that separates citation attributes with a tab so they can then be easily copy and pasted into excel files. 

Copy the contents of the macro file into your notepad++ shortcuts.xml file located here: <b>%APPDATA%\Notepad++</b>. Make sure you paste the contents between the <b>"Marcos"</b> tags, do not place them within another macro (within a set of <b>"Macro"</b> tags).


<b>Limitations:</b></br>
<ul>
<li>The macros were made for book citations; they may work with other reference types but this has not been tested.</li>
<li>The Macros put citations in the following order: Author, Year, Title, Edition. Other citation information is removed.</li>
<li>If common referencing punctuation such as <b>"("</b> or <b>"."</b> are used in the title or any other fields the citations, extra unwanted tabs may be included.</li>
</ul>

Macros were made using the record macro feature in Notepad++ and using find and replace with regualr expressions.

The macros were created for a project in 2020 and have not been reviewed or updated since.
